/*
WWOO Replace Config

===========
This config is only for replacing biomes, the main WWOO config is in the other file.

	/* Enter all WWOO biomes that should be replaced into this map.
	   As the key put the biome you want to replace and as value the biome you want to replace it with.
	   Here is an example:
	   "replace": {
	       "minecraft:plains": "minecraft:basalt_deltas",
	       "wythers:bayou": "minecraft:river"
	   }
	   Only biomes which are added trough WWOO will work.
	   Also on compatible mode you can only replace WWOO biomes and only replace them with non vanilla biomes.
	   If a biome doesn't exist, the game will crash!
