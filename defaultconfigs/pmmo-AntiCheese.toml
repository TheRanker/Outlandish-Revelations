#There are various ways in which players can exploit
#features of various mods and mechanics to gain xp at
#rates that are not intended.  The below anti-cheese

	#AFK Tracking allows you to control if and when a player
	#should not gain xp while afk.  All afk timers are configuration
	#specific, so you can configure separate thresholds for different
